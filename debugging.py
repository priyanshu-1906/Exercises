#Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# if you want to show double quotes inside the statement which you are about to print then use single quote inside print as shown below like this you can show double quotes 

print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
# another note you cannot use double quotes two times that's why we have used single quotes

print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
